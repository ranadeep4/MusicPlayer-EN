      "rootCause": "The album filtering functionality is not working as expected. The test attempts to filter for a non-existent album and expects zero results, but the UI still displays 18 elements. This indicates that the filter either failed to apply, or the filtering logic incorrectly returned all items instead of an empty set when no matches were found.",
      "suggestedFix": "1. Verify that the input for the 'non-existent album' is correctly entered into the filter field and that the application acknowledges the filter. 2. Debug the filtering logic, focusing on how it handles cases where no matching data exists. Ensure the backend or frontend filtering correctly processes the filter term and returns an empty list if no albums match. 3. Check for any UI refresh issues that might prevent the grid from updating after the filter is applied. 4. Add an intermediate assertion to confirm the filter input field actually contains the desired text before asserting the count of results.",

      "suggestedFix": "Investigate the code at `E:\\Evernorth\\Music_Player\\tests\\playSong.spec.ts:8:46` where the `expect(received).toBeTruthy()` assertion failed because it received `false`. This indicates the action being tested (likely starting a song) did not produce the expected successful outcome. Debug the code path leading to the `received` value:\n1.  **Verify Playback Logic:** Ensure the song playback function is correctly invoked and successfully starts the song.\n2.  **Check Dependencies:** Confirm all necessary components (e.g., audio player, song data) are initialized and available.\n3.  **Handle Asynchronicity:** If playback is an asynchronous operation, ensure the test properly `await`s its completion before making the assertion.",
